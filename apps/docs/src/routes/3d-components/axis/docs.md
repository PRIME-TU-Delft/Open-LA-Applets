# Axis

Axis is created to be beautifull with little effort. It is a simple component that can be used to display a 3D axis in your scene. By default it is a 10x10x10 axis, but you can change the size by passing a `axisLength` prop. The colors are 3 of the official PRIME colors. For a more minimalistic look you can disable the labels/numbers by passing `hideNumbers={true}`. You can also disable the ticks by passing `hideTicks={true}`.
