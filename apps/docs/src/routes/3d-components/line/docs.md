# Line

This component is a slight deviation from the [Vector3D component](/3d-components/vector). However, where Vector3 has some thickness, Line is approximately 1px wide. It is used to give small hints but should never be used to grab attension from the user. An example of a place where Line is used is for the Axis line.
